<title>The oxen,Tiger and the wheels</title>
<h1> The oxen and the wheels
<h2></h1> From Aesop's Fables</h2>

<p>
	Apair of oxens were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road.
	They had to use all their strenghth to pull the wagon , but they did not complain.
</p>

<p>
    The wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Thought the tasks they had to do was very light 
    compared to that of the oxen, They  creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor oxen, deep mud, had their 
    ears filled with the loud complaining of the wheels. And this, You may well know , made their works so much
    the harder to endure.

<h2>
People hate what they don't understand hate what they can't conquer. They complain most who suffer least.
